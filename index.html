            <h2>Understanding Cryptographic Hashes</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">A hash function is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity. It's a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (like a file or a password) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is unique to that input. This output is called a "hash" or a "digest". Our tool allows you to explore this concept with the most widely used algorithms.</p>

                <h3>Practical Use Cases for a Hash Generator</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Verifying File Integrity:</strong> After downloading a file, compare its calculated hash with the one provided by the source. If they match, the file is not corrupt or altered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Password Storage:</strong> Storing user passwords as hashes is a fundamental security practice. It ensures that even in a data breach, the actual passwords are not exposed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Hashing is a core component of digital signatures, used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and messages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Indexing in Databases:</strong> Hash tables, a data structure that uses hashing, allow for incredibly fast data lookups, making them essential for high-performance databases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain Technology:</strong> Each block in a blockchain contains the hash of the previous block, creating a secure and immutable chain of transactions.</li>

                <h3>MD5 vs. SHA-256: Which One Should I Use?</h3>
                <p>This is a common question. While both are hash functions, they belong to different generations of security. <strong>MD5 is considered broken and cryptographically insecure.</strong> It is fast, but it's vulnerable to "collision attacks," where two different inputs can produce the same hash. It should NOT be used for security purposes like password storage or digital signatures. Its only modern use is for non-security tasks, like generating a checksum to verify file integrity against accidental corruption.</p>
                <p><strong>SHA-256 (part of the SHA-2 family) is the current industry standard.</strong> It is secure, robust, and has no known major vulnerabilities. For any application that requires security (password hashing, digital certificates, blockchain), you should always choose a member of the SHA-2 or SHA-3 family. While slightly slower than MD5, the security it provides is non-negotiable.</p>

                <h3>What is "Salting" in Password Hashing?</h3>
                <p>You should never hash a password directly. If two users have the same password, "password123", they would have the same hash. An attacker could use a "rainbow table" (a pre-computed list of hashes for common passwords) to find a match instantly. To prevent this, we use a "salt". A salt is a unique, random string of characters that is added to each password before it's hashed. So, "password123" + "salt_for_user_A" results in a completely different hash than "password123" + "salt_for_user_B". The salt is stored alongside the hash in the database. This makes rainbow table attacks ineffective and dramatically increases password security.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>1. Is this online hash generator safe to use?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Our tool is 100% client-side, which means all hashing calculations happen directly in your browser on your computer. No data or files you input are ever sent to our servers. Your privacy and data security are guaranteed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>2. What is the difference between Hashing and Encryption?</h3>
                <p>Hashing is a one-way process; you cannot reverse a hash to get the original input. Encryption is a two-way process; data that is encrypted can be decrypted with the correct key. Hashing is used for integrity and verification, while encryption is used for confidentiality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>3. Can two different files have the same hash?</h3>
                <p>For a secure algorithm like SHA-256, it is theoretically possible but statistically impossible. This event is called a "hash collision". While collisions have been demonstrated for older, broken algorithms like MD5, it is considered computationally infeasible to find a collision for modern algorithms like SHA-256.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>4. Why are some hashes longer than others?</h3>
                <p>The length of a hash is determined by the algorithm. For example, MD5 always produces a 128-bit hash, while SHA-256 always produces a 256-bit hash. A longer hash provides a larger number of possible combinations, making it more secure against brute-force and collision attacks.</p>
